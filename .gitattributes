# These directories use the "ours" merge strategy to keep local changes
# Requires one-time setup: git config merge.ours.driver true

# Public directory - demo frontend, custom themes, user assets
public/** merge=ours

# Custom admin components - user extensions to the admin panel
admin/src/custom/** merge=ours
